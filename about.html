<div class="section-header">About me</div>

<p>Hi! I'm Nathan. I'm currently a software engineer at Apple in Cupertino.</p>

<p>I play and make games pretty avidly in my free time. My favorites are playable right here in your browser. I enjoy looking at everything that makes a game "fun"&mdash; from intricate gameplay systems that create depth, to little aesthetic touches that people hardly notice.</p>

<p>Other than that, I enjoy teaching, cooking, watching anime and movies, trying to learn to draw, and exploring new things. I used to play the violin and still try to pick it up occasionally. I also organize <a href="/puzzles">puzzle hunts</a> with my friends, though I'm less active with that these days.</p>

<p>Catch me on <a href="http://twitter.com/npinsker">Twitter</a> if you want to say hi!</p>
